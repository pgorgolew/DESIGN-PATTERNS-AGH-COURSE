Here are some tricks to find out without coming out and asking him | 32
Ask him to carry your backpack to class | 22
Tell him its heavy and he looks strong enough to carry it easily | 33
If he says yes it probably means that he likes you enough to do favors for you and likes that you think hes strong | 57
If you want to tell one of your friends something when hes there tell him to close his ears or to step back a little | 57
This will make him want to hear whats going on even more and youll know that he cares | 43
Be sure he does not already have a girlfriend | 21
Double check to make sure that none of your friends like him | 29
You dont want to stir up a lot of drama with your friends because you might lose a friend and scare your crush away | 55
If one of your friends does like him you should discuss who gets him | 33
If you cant come to a fair agreement such as who liked him first he chooses etc | 37
both of you should move on | 12
If you decide to let your friend go after him and they get together dont hold it against her | 45
Stay friends with her | 13
Be happy for them and realize that there will be plenty of other boys in your future | 43
If you dont get the person you like dont get sad | 23
Be confident in who you are deep down inside and love yourself from the inside out | 38
Sometimes after a boy realizes you like them that way they start to see you in a different light | 46
Even if he says no he may start to subconsciously think about the characteristics that he likes about you or why you would make a good girlfriend | 72
Shy boys dont always have the courage to tell other people how they really feel or they dont know how to | 54
If you like a shy boy and he doesnt seem interested it could be because he gets nervous around you and doesnt know what to do | 58
If he is shy keep trying to make him feel comfortable around you | 31
Definitely hang out with him in places where he is most comfortable | 35
Its definitely tough being a middleschooler but youre beginning to learn how to balance out all the work and drama in your life | 62
Dont be too overcommitted or you wont have time to hang out with him and remember that theres more to life than middle school and it wont be long before youre not even sure what you ever saw in that boyIf he feels he cant keep up with you he might get too nervous and think that youre out of his league | 142
If you are very socially active invite him to come along one day with you and some of your friends | 44
This will give him a chance to be around you outside of school and in your natural state | 40
Dont make him feel like youre never around | 19
If you bring him along make sure he feels comfortable | 26
Likewise dont undercommit or you could seem like a loser | 26
You want to surround your life with interesting activities and friends regardless of whether he likes you | 54
If he does like you your life just got that much better | 26
If he doesnt like you your life is fun and meaningful without him This means being comfortable in your own skin doing what you want to do and saying what you want to say | 82
The people who dont love and respect you for who you are truly arent worth fighting for | 45
Dont try to be somebody youre not | 17
Hell like you just the way you are | 15
You may even have some things in common | 19
Let him know youre interested but not desperate | 24
If youre not sure where hes at be careful about following these steps they might not turn out the way you had hopedAsk him Hey would you like to hang out with me sometime | 81
If he says yes youve done your part | 16
Smile and tell him you have to go | 15
Then walk away without looking back | 19
Now the ball is in his court | 14
Suggest going to the movies or a school sports game together | 31
Asking him to the movies would be a little more formal of a date but you could also suggest going with friends | 53
Asking him to a school sports game doesnt have to be a date | 28
It could just be you two hanging out | 17
Ask him out to Sadie Hawkins dance if these are ever held where you live | 32
Sadie Hawkins is when the girls ask the boys out for a dance | 30
Pile up your courage and ask him whether hed want to be your date | 30
If he says yes he definitely likes you | 18
If this still isnt impressing him try some love letters | 32
Make a cute flirty playful letter from a secret admirer and leave it in his locker | 41
Leave a secret code word like flower at the end of every note saying if he finds out who you are to say this word to him | 55
After the first week start dropping hints that its you by writing about things in the letter that he likes and then talking to him about them | 77
Once he sees your common interests he is sure to give you a chance | 29
Dont write anything that you would be embarrassed about if anyone else read it | 38
Letters can get misplaced | 15
If someone else finds your letter you could both be in for some teasing | 33
