 Challenge 1. Your goal is to write software that displays a shape in the window.
 You can use Swift or another graphical library in Java/JavaScript/Python.
 User should be able DYNAMICALLY to select: shape, colour and line style by using the buttons (or radio buttons).
 Possible shapes are: triangle, square, circle. Possible shapes colours are: red, green, and blue.
 Possible line style: solid, dotted and dashed. Using the decorator design pattern is obligatory.
